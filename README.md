All code to generate the csv files is in the Main_Code.ipynb. 

Prior to running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have downloaded and unzipped the following files from this link: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/. Must be in the same directory as the Main_Code.ipynb.

1. title.basics.tsv.gz
2. title.principals.tsv.gz
3. name.basics.tsv.gz

After the code runs, you will see CSV files in the 'logistics' and 'networks' folder. Pre-compiled CSV files can be found in folder named "Pre-Compiled CSV Files".
